# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a beginner developer who understands that I am just starting out.
I may not have a lot of experience yet, but I am highly motivated to learn, grow, and improve my skills every day.
Most of my projects are made for my own gaming community and to solve real-world tasks â€” I enjoy building tools that I use myself.

Right now, my priority is not salary, but the opportunity for professional growth and development in a friendly environment.
I don't just want to learn â€” I want to level up so that eventually I can work in the United States. I'm genuinely interested in American tech, work culture, and the opportunities for growth there.

I'm ready to take on challenges, learn from mentors, and contribute to interesting projects.
